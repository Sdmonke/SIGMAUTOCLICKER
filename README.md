# SIGMAUTOCLICKER
SIGMAUTOCLICER! Yes, obviously the name is from the brainrot term "sigma". You are not able to put a number but have to put 0.0001 and stuff like that because you're setting the sleep time, I couldn't find out how to reverse the number. Anyway it can click upto a 1000cps and more, so enjoy!
